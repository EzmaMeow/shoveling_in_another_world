#states may be static in memory, but some cases a copy be more ideal
#since states may contain dynamic feilds like current hp and making a dedicated
#file for each enemy instance is not ideal for that case
#I was going to make it unique by default, but I feel they may be fix in memory most times
#having a ref to a static state is still recommened so that the base states can be update
#this type of state usally is used with saving
